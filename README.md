Retailers struggle with repetitive buying and missed product opportunities. Qwipo Recommend AI uses transaction insights and Apriori rules to deliver real-time, personalized product suggestions, boosting orders, repeat purchases, and inventory efficiency.
# Qwipo-AI-Recommend  

## Problem Statement  
Retailers often face repetitive buying patterns and miss product opportunities. This leads to lower sales, poor inventory turnover, and reduced customer satisfaction.  

## Project Description  
Qwipo Recommend AI is designed to solve this problem by using transaction insights and Apriori rules to generate real-time, personalized product suggestions. With this system, retailers can:  
- Boost orders  
- Increase repeat purchases  
- Improve inventory efficiency  

## Proposal & Prototype Plan  
We will collect transaction data in CSV format and process it using Python libraries like *Pandas*. The Apriori algorithm will be applied to identify frequent item sets and recommend products accordingly.  

*Plan of Work:*  
- *Phase 1*: Data collection and preprocessing  
- *Phase 2*: Implementation of Apriori algorithm  
- *Phase 3*: Model testing with sample datasets  
- *Phase 4*: Prototype development  
- *Phase 5*: Documentation and presentation  

## Features to be Implemented  
- Real-time product recommendations  
- Personalized suggestions for each retailer  
- Inventory optimization insights  
- User-friendly interface for accessing recommendations  

## Tech Stack  
- *Programming Language*: Python  
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
*Algorithm*: Apriori Association Rule Mining  

## Contribution Details  
- *Triveni*: Data collection & preprocessing  
- *Reshmanjali*: Implementation of Apriori algorithm  
- *Jyothi*: Model testing & evaluation  
- *Atchamma*: Prototype design & development  
- *sree vidya*: Documentation & presentation preparation
